# Week08 Midterm Project presentations

Presentations will all take place Tuesday. If you do not present, your midterm will lose points for lateness. Final code submissions along with a copy of your presentation are due by Friday, Oct 31 at midnight, no exceptions. Midterm progress grades are due that Sunday. If you do not submit a midterm for grading, you will recieve a 0.

## A reminder on Grading Policy:

As per the Syllabus:

- Your Midterm project is 25% of your final grade.
- Participation and attendance is also 25%.
- 3 or more unexcused absences result in your final grade being dropped a full letter grade. Some of you already have 3 or more absences. When you miss a class it is up to YOU to read the class notes and review the in class code examples. Depending on how midterm presenations and code, I may suggest dropping the course due to your lack of effort or understanding of the material.
